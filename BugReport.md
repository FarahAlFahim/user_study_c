## Title: JobImpl.finished doesn't expect ERROR as a final job state

## Description
The issue arises in the Hadoop MapReduce application when the `JobImpl.finished` method is called with an invalid job state of `'ERROR'`. This state is not accounted for in the method's switch-case structure, leading to an `IllegalArgumentException`.

## StackTrace
```
    java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Illegal job state: ERROR,
        at org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.job.impl.JobImpl.finished(JobImpl.java:838),
        at org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.job.impl.JobImpl$InternalErrorTransition.transition(JobImpl.java:1622),
        at org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.job.impl.JobImpl$InternalErrorTransition.transition(JobImpl.java:1)
```

## RootCause
The root cause of the issue is that the `JobImpl.finished` method does not handle the `'ERROR'` state, which leads to an `IllegalArgumentException` being thrown when this state is encountered. This indicates that the job has transitioned into an error state that was not properly managed, likely due to internal errors during job execution.

## Suggestions
Implement handling for the `'ERROR'` state in the `JobImpl.finished` method. Consider logging the error and transitioning to a safe state instead of throwing an exception.

## ProblemLocation
```
{
    class: JobImpl.java,
    methods: [JobImpl.finished, JobImpl$InternalErrorTransition.transition]
}
```

## PossibleFix
Modify the `JobImpl.finished` method to include a case for handling the `'ERROR'` state. For example:
```java
case ERROR:
    // Handle the error state appropriately
    log.error("Job encountered an error state: " + finalState);
    return finalState;
```
